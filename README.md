A bootstrap project for building Phaser games using ES6 and Webpack.

This project supports Cordova, specifically compiling to:

* Web Browsers
* iOS
* Android

## Development

Ensure you have NodeJS installed.

1. Clone this repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/udia-software/phaser-cordova-es6.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    Navigate to the cloned repoâ€™s directory.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ``` 

3. Run the webpack code compiler and watcher:

    Run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will run webpack which minimizes and compile the **development** bundle into `www`.

4. Run Cordova commands.

    In a new terminal window, run the following

    ```bash
    # To test browser development locally
    cordova run browser -- --live-reload
    ```


## Build for deployment:

Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will uglify and minimize the compiled **production** bundle into `www`.

Afterwards, you can use Cordova to build and run the browser and native ios/android applications.

```bash
cordova run android
# Run application on Android/Emulator
cordova run ios
# Run application on iOS/Emulator
cordova run browser
# Same as development browser run command, without live reload
```
